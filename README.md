## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

-How to link HTML to an external CSS file

- How to center items in a container

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
   display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
```

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me in CSS for centering items. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
